/**
 * Paper Content Adapter — a {@link DocumentContentAdapter} that additionally
 * knows about Lean and LaTeX.
 *
 * ## A paper is a document plus Lean-bearing blocks
 *
 * That sentence is the whole design. A paper folio and a document folio have
 * the same content model (a tree of chapters and sections over `.ts` + `.md`
 * block pairs), the same editorial `uses[]` graph, the same QA sidecars, the
 * same HCI validation gate, the same feedback and review workflow, and the
 * same publication lifecycle. What a paper adds is:
 *
 * - **block kinds whose assertion is a formal claim** — `definition`,
 *   `theorem`, `lemma`, `proposition`, `corollary`, `conjecture`, `proof`
 *   (`MATH_BLOCK_KINDS` in `schemas/block-kinds.ts`), each backed by a
 *   `.lean` sibling; and
 * - **two toolchains** to serve them: the Lean lifecycle (`lean_setup`,
 *   `lean_build`, `lean_check`, `lean_status`) and the LaTeX renderer
 *   (`paper_render_pdf`, `paper_render_html`, `formula_render`); and
 * - **the tools that read those artifacts** — `content_build` (which emits
 *   `.tex`), `migrate_lean_refs`, `proof_status`, `latex_preflight`, and ten
 *   audits over `.tex` output, Lean witnesses and the theorem-like kinds. On a
 *   document folio each of those would answer nothing forever, and a check
 *   that never looked reporting clean is worse than one that is absent.
 *
 * Everything else is inherited, which is why this file is short. If a change
 * belongs in both content types, it belongs in the base class; if it needs a
 * TeX or Lean installation, it belongs here.
