/**
 * This instance DECLARES the paper adapter, and the harness finds it there.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-30 the harness named this directory itself —
 * `../folio-assistant-sci/adapters/paper/index.ts` in `src/builtin-adapters.ts` —
 * and its test asserted `layer: "sci"`. The dependency is inverted now (bean
 * `p11x`): the declaration lives in `folio-assistant-sci.json`, so the
 * assertion that paper is THIS instance's lives with it, and the harness's own
 * test holds in a checkout of the harness alone.
