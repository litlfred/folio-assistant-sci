    // a source line number, because `stripLeanComments` now writes the newline

    // **THIS TEST PINNED THE DEFECT, deliberately and with its reasons.** It
    // asserted `b` on line **4** — the collapsed number — because

    // files, 3,931 (99.0%) shifted, losing 281,234 lines. The author filed

    // change with its own before/after, and asserted the real behaviour so the
