/**
 * folio-assistant-sci's Tool nodes: the `tools` graph for the science layer.
 *
 * @module folio-assistant-sci/tools
 * @graphNode tool
 *
 * Reached by the harness through tool auto-discovery (`cat-harness/tools/
 * discover.ts`, bean `p0za`), never by an import, as `folio-assistant-core`'s
 * are. A Tool node is a declaration read at load; these invoke shell commands,
 * so declaring them copies no code.
 *
 * ## The iterative paper build (issue #2117, 2026-10-04)
 *
 * The owner asked for the loop litlfred/qou used to iterate on a large paper,
 * as "new skill/tools". It has four steps, governed by the `latex-build-cache`
 * skill:
 *
 * 1. `latex-preflight` (cat-harness), a static check that needs no TeX;
 * 2. `tex-install`, to get an engine into a sandbox that has none;
 * 3. `paper-feature-build`, which compiles only the changed chapters plus a
 *    latexdiff of each, with margin notes off;
 * 4. `paper-latex-build` (cat-harness), the full render.
 *
 * Steps 2 and 3 had no Tool node, so an agent searching the tools graph could
 * not find the loop; and step 3 could not run anywhere, because it read the
 * preamble deleted in `34a70659c7`. It now lives beside the recovered print
 * template in `adapters/paper/latex/`.
